<h2>About this site</h2>

<p>Inspired by this forum posting - <i><a href="http://flightgear.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=7357&p=69752&hilit=requests#p69752"><b>Website for requesting a controller</b></a></i></p>

<p>You usually only need air traffic controllers when you are taking off or landing (even though there are center controllers), 
so I thought of making a website which allows you to request controllers when you are going to takeoff or land.
And with flightgear's terrasync and the ability for controllers to teleport anywhere such a service could be possible.
 This could also be helpful for people who are ATC, because they dont have to stay at one place for a long time just to serve 1 or 2 pilots.</p>
<p>
I love designing websites, so I have already started on the layout of the site, which you can check out here: http://nafis.us.to/fg_atc. I am currently working on the actual script which would allow the guys logged in as ATC to view requests from pilots. Its not very hard so I could finish the whole site in about a week, except for the next two weeks I will be very busy (so busy I might not even be able to go on flightgear!).</p>
<p>
Anyway, I hope that this could help flightgear get closer to becoming similar to vatsim, and that im not just being a noob. :|</p>

<p><b>fg@freeflightsim.org</b> is an user account with a <b>public calendar</b> on the domain <b>FreeFlightSim.org</b>. This site works by remotely adding users in <b>edit mode</b> to the calendar, enabling maintainance of entries.</p>

<p>Its R &amp; D and work in progress, trying to find a solution that works for everyone, is easily managable and updateable. Currently the toolkit and service being used is Google Calendar as this has all the widgets, authentication, feeds etc.</p>

<p>The disadvantage is that a google account is required. This does not mean that you need a new email address etc, but instead can use your existing address to create a "token" with google.
</p>
<p>The advantage is that it makes access to google services including access easy. For the developers its much easier to 
code and more secure.
