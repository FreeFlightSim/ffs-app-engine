<p style=""><img src="/images/SNAG-0006.jpg" style="float:right; margin-left: 20px;"><b><b class="fg">FlightGear</b> is a Flight Sim that offers <b>Real Life Flying</b> with Accurate WorldWide Scenery based on Actual NASA Data, over 20,000 of the World's Airports and 100+ Different Aircraft
</b></p>



<p>With 100+ aircraft to master, from the <a href="http://wiki.flightgear.org/index.php/Wright_Flyer_1903">1903 Wright Flyer</a> to the latest <a href="http://wiki.flightgear.org/index.php/Military_aircraft">military</a> fighter jet and you know you will be busy for months.</p>

I loaded the <a href="http://wiki.flightgear.org/index.php/747">747</a> to attempt a flight. Once airborne, you immediately notice the lag in the controls as you attempt to maneuver this juggernaut of the sky.... faithfully reproduces the feeling of flying a “heavy”, with all the sedateness you would expect.

<h3><img src="/images/icon8.gif">One of the Most Realistic Flight Sims Available</h3>


<p><img src="/images/SNAG-1185.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;"><b class="fg">FlightGear</b> has been and is being developed to be <b>as close to real life as possible</b>. Everything from terrain, aircraft reactions, to planetary alignments and movements.</p>


<p>The virtual controls are <b>modeled on Real Life cockpits</b> and you will find night flying more enjoyable with <b>ground lighting</b> concentrated in urban areas and accurate airport approach lighting. It doesn't get any closer to the real thing...</p>

<h3><img src="/images/icon16.gif">You get 100% Freedom, Amazing Scenery 
And A Sophisticated Sky Model</h3>


<p style="margin-right: 30px;"><img src="/images/note.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"><b class="fg">FlightGear</b> features highly detailed time of day modeling that places the sun, moon, stars, and planets correctly based on Real Time data from your computer clock.</p>

<p><b>If it's dawn in Beijing right now, it's dawn in the sim right now when you locate yourself in virtual Beijing.</b></p>

<p>The sun, moon, stars, and planets all follow their correct courses through the sky. The modeling also correctly takes into account seasonal effects so you have 24 hour days north of the Arctic Circle in the Summer.</p>

<h3><img src="/images/icon10.gif">Changeable Weather</h3>

<p><img src="/images/SNAG-0052.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;">If flying with perfect weather at dawn is just not a challenge anymore, why not add another dimension and watch your plane <b>soar through gail's, wind, rain, snow or even lightning</b>. You have the control to choose this, or for added realism why not use real life data.</p>

<p>

<b class="fg">FlightGear</b> can calculate your nearest airport and fetch the current <b>METAR for that station from the NOAA weather service</b>. The atmosphere parameters calculated are: temperature, dew point, pressure density, wind (three dimensional) and visibility
</p>


<div class="quote">

<img src="/images/speech.jpg" class="ileft">
<p>
The aircraft responds to control inputs, just as the real one would, it is quite astonishing the quality of the flying produced in this simulator. To be honest, in this respect it's so polished, I could write page after page on it, but I'm sure by now you get the idea...
</p>
</div>









<h3><img src="/images/icon15.gif">Over 100+ Planes and Helicopters</h3>

<p><img src="/images/SNAG-0009.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;">The list of available aircraft varies from the <b>Wright Brother’s first plane</b> to today’s state-of-the-art <b>military fighter jets</b> and even medical <b>helicopters</b>. As for available terrains, you can <b>fly anywhere on the entire planet!</b></p>

<p><b>With realism from the sloped runways to the real life controls, this sim makes you realize what you've been missing all these years.</b></p>

<p>It's really makes for an interesting experience when you release the brakes and find yourself rolling backwards down the runway.</p>





<h3><img src="/images/icon3.gif">Now You Are In Control</h3>

<p><img src="/images/SNAG-0007.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;">The added bonus is that <b class="fg">FlightGear</b> is based on OpenGL graphics rendering. This means the program can really do just about anything and make it look realistic.</p>

<p><b class="fg">FlightGear</b> is an open source  flight sim that gives you complete control. This means you can dig deeper into the simulation and create your own graphics including: livery, terrain, airports, and of course aircraft.</p>

<p>You can also completely reprogram your flight controls and control response. The graphics and customization are only <b>as limited as your imagination.</b></p>

You can customize every aspect of your flight; a common feature on flight simulators. From the time of day to the type of navigation; even control over the weather and clouds, as well as the ability to toggle the 3D cockpit on and off–you can do it all! I’m very impressed with the interface overall. <br>

<h3><img src="/images/icon11.gif"> Flexible and Open Aircraft Modeling System:</h3>



<p><img src="/images/800px-Alpha6.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;"><b class="fg">FlightGear</b>  has the ability to model a wide variety of aircraft. Currently there are over 100 different planes and helicopters available for you to fly.</p>

<p>These range from the 1903 Wright Flyer, strange flapping wing "Ornithopters", a 747, A320, various military jets, and several light singles. <b class="fg">FlightGear</b> has the ability to model those aircraft and just about everything in between.</p>

 

<p>The infrastructure has been created to allow aircraft designers to build fully animated, fully operational, fully interactive 3D cockpits (which even update and display correctly from external chase plane views.)</p>



<p><img src="/images/800px-Howto-_animate_gear_scissors_oleo.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;"><b class="fg">FlightGear</b>  is proudly part of the Open Source community. This means <b class="fg">FlightGear</b>  is in constant development and keeps getting better and better. If you require further information or want to help develop <b class="fg">FlightGear</b>  further please have a look at our Developers Area.</p>

<h3><img src="/images/icon12.gif"> Realistic Controls</h3>

<p><img src="/images/SNAG-1474.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;"><b class="fg">FlightGear</b> has extremely smooth and fluid instrument animation that updates at the same rate as your out-the-window view updates (i.e. as fast as your computer can crank, and not artificially limited and chunky like in some sims.)</p>


<p><b class="fg">FlightGear</b> realistically models real world instrument behavior. Instruments that lag in real life, lag correctly, gyro drift is modeled correctly, themagnetic compass is subject to aircraft body forces...</p>


<p><img src="/images/note1.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">Instrument and system failures are also accurately recreated. If the vacuum system fails, the HSI gyros spin down slowly with a corresponding degradation in response as well as a slowly increasing bias/error. All those things that make flying a challenge are accurately recreated to give YOU the most Real Life Flying experience. See the world with <b class="fg">FlightGear</b> today!</p>

When flying the simulator in the evening here in the UK, San Francisco was in broad daylight. If I changed the airport to London Stansted, it immediately turned to night. So the program is linked to a world time base to compensate for time of day...
